# Parking Management System

A simple console-based application for managing a parking lot, developed in C# as part of a programming challenge.

## 📖 About the Project

This project simulates a basic parking management system. It allows the user to register vehicles entering the lot, record their departure, list all parked vehicles, and calculate the parking fee based on the duration of their stay. The primary goal of this project was to practice fundamental C# concepts, including classes, lists, and user input handling.

## ✨ Features

-   **Add Vehicle**: Register a new vehicle by entering its license plate.
-   **Remove Vehicle**: Remove a vehicle from the lot and calculate the total fee.
-   **List Vehicles**: Display the license plates of all vehicles currently parked.
-   **Dynamic Fee Calculation**: The final price is calculated based on an initial fee plus an additional charge per hour the vehicle remained parked.
-   **Interactive Menu**: A user-friendly command-line interface to navigate through the options.
